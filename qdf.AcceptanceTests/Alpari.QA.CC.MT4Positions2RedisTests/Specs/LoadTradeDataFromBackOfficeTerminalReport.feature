Feature: LoadTradeDataFromBackOfficeTerminalReport
	In order to test MT4Positions2Redis
	As a CC Tester
	I want to be able to parse the MT4 html report

##was going to use html and htmlagilitypack but the html reports are for single accounts only. Using Back Office Terminal to generate csv instead
#Scenario: Add two numbers
#	Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
#	And I have entered 70 into the calculator
#	When I press add
#	Then the result should be 120 on the screen
