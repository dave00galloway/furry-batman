Scenario Outline: Check with valid data 
	Given I have the following search criteria for qdf deals
		 | DealSource | DealType     |
		 | cnx-deals  | BookLessDeal |
	When I load cnx trade activities for "<reportDate>" for the included logins
		And I retrieve the qdf deal data filtered by cnx hub start and end times and by included logins
		And I compare the cnx hub trade deals with the qdf deal data excluding these fields:
		 | ExcludedFields |
		 | Comment        |
		 | AccountGroup   |
		 | Book           |
		 | OrderId        |
		 | State          |
	Then the cnx hub trade deals should match the qdf deal data exactly:-
		| ExportType     |  Overwrite |
		| DataTableToCsv |  true      |
	Examples: 
	| reportDate |
	| 07/29/2014 |
	| 07/30/2014 |
	| 07/31/2014 |
	| 08/01/2014 |
	| 08/04/2014 |

Scenario Outline: Check with a report date with known errors 
	Given I have the following search criteria for qdf deals
		 | DealSource | DealType     |
		 | cnx-deals  | BookLessDeal |
	When I load cnx trade activities for "<reportDate>" for the included logins
		And I retrieve the qdf deal data filtered by cnx hub start and end times and by included logins
		And I compare the cnx hub trade deals with the qdf deal data excluding these fields:

		 | AccountGroup   |
		 | Book           |
		 | OrderId        |
		 | State          |
	Then the cnx hub trade deals compared with the qdf deal data should contain 40 "mismatches":-
		| ExportType         |
		| DataTableToConsole |
	
	Examples: 
	| reportDate |
